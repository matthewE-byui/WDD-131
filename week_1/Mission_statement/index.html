* I personally had some trouble with the live server extension in VS Code. It would not 
  display my HTML file in the browser. I tried reloading it and what not, but it still wouldnt show
  anything. So I went thrugh the extensions and I found one from Microsoft called "Live Preview".
  I installed it and it worked perfectly. If anyone has problems with the old purple live server 
  extension, try this one out. I also took a little bit of this class a while ago with another teacher 
  and didnt finish it thats why I copied and pasted some of the code.
